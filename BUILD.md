# Building

## Requirements

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation

- Clone the repository
- Run `npm install` in the coffee-log-client directory
- Run `ng start` in the coffee-log-client directory
- Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`

For right now it is just a client, more will be added in the future to build out an API which will connect to a database.
