## What is this app? 🤷🏻‍♂️  

Have you ever had a great cup of joe and after it is all finished you wondered what the roast was, where it was originally from, and what the flavor notes were so you could grab some for your own home coffee bar? I know I have! and so it dawned on me. Coffee shares the community and sophistication like wine. And with wine, there are a whole host of apps that catalogue your wines and allow you to rate them so that you can reference them later. That way you can know just what wine was your favorite. Well, why not have the same thing, but with coffee? Hence the coffee catalogue. Don't worry, I am still thinkning of a good, permenant name.

## Goals 🎯

The goals of this project are as follows:

- Create a full stack application which allows users over the internet to log their coffee brews.
- Allow users to rate their brews and add notes to them.
- Allow users to search for brews by name, roast, and flavor notes.
- Allow users to add new brews to the database.
- Allow users to edit brews in the database.
- Allow users to delete brews from the database.

More goals may be added over time. This is just a rough outline of what I want to accomplish.
